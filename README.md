## Intro

**WHY** building a template project like this?

React alone is a library; it does not include structures known from frameworks like Angular. Nevertheless, some structures establish themselves over time, structures that are more or less the same in most projects. This project represents one possible structure out of many, but one that has proven itself for me, [@cmmd_mx](https://github.com/cmmdmx).

So this is _a template for everyone_, who wants to build a react-based site _simple, fast & efficient_.

The project is based on following tech stack:

- React + ReactDom
- ReactRouterDom
- State Management Baobab.js & Baobab-react by [@Yomguithereal](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/)
- SCSS + CSS Modules Styling

This project is based on some more and some less popular patterns - make sure you understand the concepts before start coding.
